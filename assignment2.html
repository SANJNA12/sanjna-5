    <h1>Why I want to become a web developer</h1>
    <p>Web development is a fast-paced, challenging career centered on creative problem-solving and continuous innovation. The reason behind to become a Web developer is that in html css code we can see the changes on a live preview and less chances of errors as compared to other programming languages. I chose to become a web developer because I could make a living wage, create amazing work that people use everyday.</p>
